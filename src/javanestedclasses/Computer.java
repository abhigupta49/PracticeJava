//1. Inner Class
//
//Write a Java program to create an outer class called  Computer with an inner class Processor. The Processor class should have a method "displayDetails()" that prints the details of the processor (e.g., brand and speed). Create an instance of Processor from the Computer class and call the "displayDetails()" method.
public class Computer {

    class Processor{
        void displayDetails(){
            System.out.println("Processor Brand: Intel");
            System.out.println("Processor Speed: 3.5 GHz");
        }
    }

    public void showProcessorDetails(){
        Processor processor = new Processor();
        processor.displayDetails();
    }
}
